# Case Study: Forum Software

## User stories
As user, I want to...
* Create an account, log in and log out
* View a list of posts in frontpage
* Create new posts
* View posts and their comments
* Create comments in existing posts

## Limitations
* No user roles or any kind of moderation functionality
* No pagination, too many topics or posts per topic means trouble
